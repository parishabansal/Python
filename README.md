# Credit Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing credit data to gain insights into customer behavior, evaluate risk factors, and prepare the data for potential machine learning models. By leveraging data-driven techniques, this project aims to assist in effective decision-making in credit management and risk assessment.

## Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing and summarizing the data to understand patterns and trends.
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis, including handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numeric data.
- Insights: Deriving actionable insights to inform business decisions.

Data Description
The dataset used in this project contains information related to credit data. Below is a brief description of the dataset's structure:

Columns/Features:
  - Customer_ID: Unique identifier for each customer.
  - Age: Age of the customer.
  - Income: Monthly or annual income (numeric).
  - Credit_Score: Numeric value representing the creditworthiness of a customer.
  - Loan_Status: Whether a loan application was approved or rejected (categorical).
  - Loan_Amount: Amount requested by the customer.
  - Default_History: Indicates if the customer has a history of defaulting on loans.
  - Gender: Gender of the customer (categorical).
  - Other Features: Additional relevant attributes that provide more context about the credit data.


 Work Done
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Visualized the distribution of numerical features like `Credit_Score` and `Income`.
   - Analyzed relationships between `Loan_Status` and other features to identify trends or patterns.
   - Identified outliers and anomalies in data using boxplots and scatterplots.

2. Data Cleaning:
   - Checked for missing values and applied strategies like mean/mode imputation or deletion based on the context.
   - Removed duplicate entries and handled inconsistencies in categorical features (e.g., standardizing labels).

3. Feature Engineering:
   - Encoded categorical variables using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
   - Scaled numerical variables to standardize their range and improve model performance.
   - Created derived metrics, such as `Debt-to-Income Ratio`, for enhanced analysis.

4. Visualization:
   - Generated plots (histograms, boxplots, heatmaps, etc.) to highlight key findings.
   - Used pair plots and correlation matrices to identify relationships between variables.

Key Insights
- Customers with lower credit scores and a history of defaults are less likely to have their loans approved.
- Higher-income levels positively correlate with loan approvals.
- The credit score is a strong predictor of loan approval status.

Data Limitations
- Missing or incomplete records in some columns, handled during preprocessing.
- Potential bias in `Loan_Status` due to unbalanced class distribution.

Requirements
To run this project, install the necessary libraries:
